 ==balance== 
 This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word, and a huge amount about the slang/profane uses. Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  

  
 i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very """"mean"""" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!It also stands for the name Brittany Fellows—Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ==etymology== 
 The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning """"female of the dog"""" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that """"the converse is equally possible."""" 
 The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  
 The verb meaning to complain in 1930. 
 Slang Bitchen """"good"""" is attested to the 1950's 

 == reclaiming the word bitch == 
 The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is """"pig"""", """"dog"""", """"cow"""" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to """"reclaim"""" as bitch simply means a female canine. 

 It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. 

    
 It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women """"reclaiming"""" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word """"bitch"""" any more than it reclaims the word """"sinner."""" 

 Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? 

 

 :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, """"She's a Bitch"""".   

 ::References are fine  just the name """"Missy Elliot"""" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned """"reclaiming"""" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   

 :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting """"querolous"""", """"spiteful"""", and """"malicious"""" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   

 ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   

 :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like """"bitch"""" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of """"bitch"""" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it.

 Thank you for adding an entry for Proornis on wikipedia. I have added a bit more info and correct some of your edits: 
 * try to use the Taxobox in a correct manner. In your case you added dromaesauridae as a family of archaeornithiformes and there was no mention of the genus and species. 
 * don't overcategorized your article. Proornis to my knowledge is considered a basal bird and do not really fit in the dinosaur or coelurosaur categories.  
 * add references whenever possible 
 * start an article by defining the subject. For instance: """"Proornis"""" is an extinct genus of bird discovered in North Korea.

 :::Second, I think you're not being quite forthright when you describe the accupressure citations as """"controvert[ing] this conclusion"""".  In fact, you removed the last two and silently changed the other two.  If you want to change text that someone has already responded to, please use  and <\s>, like this, so it doesn't look like you're being sneaky.  This also looks like you're throwing in every citation you can find without reading or understanding them, hoping something will stick.  If you recall, I asked for one pdf and we're now at numbers 16 and 17 and you're just now learning what the issues are.  And, after taking a look, neither one of your new studies has anything to do with establishing the existence of """"energy systems in the body"""". 

 :::I'm not sure what to say at this point.  The most charitable interpretation I can come up with is that you're not reading what you're citing:  you're either cutting and pasting from google or some other source.  Alternatively you're reading all of these papers but have no understanding as to what they contain.  Either way, you might want to consider editing articles that better play to your strengths. 

 :::As to Feinstein's rejoinder:  it's available here.  This is an excellent lesson in tapdancing: 

 ::::[The studies he found] lend[] support for the efficacy  of tapping while mentally attuning to an emotional difficulty. Despite the design flaws found in some of the  studies, the preponderance of evidence shows energy psychology interventions to be efficacious. 

 :::The first sentence is true, but he neglects to explain why arm-tapping and doll-tapping have equal efficacy.  The second sentence equates talking and tapping with """"energy psychology"""" which has the additional baggage of energy fields that can evidently migrate to arms and dolls.   

 :::So after 18 citations what we have is the suggestion that a particular kind of talking associated with some sort of physical ritual can be more helpful than other treatments in some situations.  I would be comfortable including the two Feinstein reviews if the shortcomings pointed out in Pignotti are highlighted, and I think Waite (2003) deserves a paragraph.  I don't see an argument for including any of these other citations.  If you want to make such an argument, please be sure to read the citation first and be able to summarize how the citation supports the point you want to make.

 You wrote: 

 You will need to cite reliable sources for the assertions """"far too large to be chemical"""" and """"no endothermic storage events"""". I do not think any source can conclusively estabish either point . . . 

 It is very easy to establish both points, and there are hundreds of papers with proof of them. 

 1. The limits of chemical storage (electron bonds) are well understood. The most energy dense chemicals, such as gasoline, store 4 to 8 eV per atom. Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this, ranging from ~100 to ~100,000 eV per atom of the material in the cell, and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction, and no chemical ash after it finishes. Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat  as much as several kilograms of gasoline. if you were to burn the cell contents, they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat. In fact, you could burn the cell, the table, and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy. Therefore, chemistry is ruled out. 

 2. Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event. For example, all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of Pd-D at the beginning of the experiment. Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat, they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it. They have never done this. The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts, and after.

  my comments follow, bluewillow991967 - 

 I'm sorry if I wasn't sufficiently clear.  

 On the specific subject of """"first serial"""" versus """"reprints"""" I have an interest because I write commercial fiction for a living. 

 I'm not saying a contract would contain a """"non-standard definition"""" of first serial, original, or reprint. 

 I'm saying that you quite clearly do not understand the *standard* definitions in publishing commercial fiction of first serial, original, and reprint. 

 """"Is"""" means the same thing in plain English as it does in intellectual property terminology. """"Reprint,"""" """"original"""" and """"first serial"""" mean much more specific things in intellectual property terminology than they do in colloquial English. 

 It may well be suitable to call a female crotch a vagina in a personal blog, but in an encyclopedia article talking about female genitalia, it matters that the colloquially used term is factually incorrect and the correct terminology should be used. If the correct terminology would be confusing to readers, then a hyperlink to a correct definition may be in order. 

 You are, by analogy, effectively insisting that a set of labia is a vagina. 

 (Sorry, clearest example I could think of where the commonly accepted vernacular term shouldn't be used in an encyclopedia article because it's wrong.)

The key here that I think GoldDragon needs to understand (and trust me, I have experience with POV pushers) is that Wikipedia is not a place to campaign, all additions to the article need to be entirely factual and presented in a clearly neutral manner - something that  seems to have done well. GoldDragon's edits (specifically the ones identified as contentious in this discussion) should be reworked to be presented in a neutral manner, or else removed. In addition, this issue of what is notable enough for inclusion has come up often in my own disputes. The most useful tool I've come up with to deal with this is to ask myself """"Will the average, a-political Torontonian find this information useful?"""" Things like the election sign business for example; while interesting to those who are intensely involved, if you were to ask the average person, they'd probably say something along the lines of """"Who cares?"""" That, I find, is a good measure of notability when dealing with trivia in politician articles

 ==US== 
 I'm trying not to just be a whinger and a hand waver here, but it annoys me that there's an entire section devoted to left vs. right politics in the US, yet there's nothing similar regarding the rest of the world. The US bias of wikipedia is very irritating sometimes, though it shouldn't be, as most Internet users are in the U.S. In other words, i'm a whiny European who is too lazy to write a non US section. 

 From the US>  That's easy to fix.  Start writing more about non-US views on topics, creating topics, and  getting your friends to help.  Something that is created by users being called biased only reflects the predominant users posting and thus can easily be remedied. 

 Also from the US> No, it's NOT so easy to fix. Throughout Wikipedia you will see entries from (obviously) American authors who have no concept of a world view and automatically write from a US perspective without any attempt to qualify their language. What, therefore, tends to happen is that the US view becomes a default with international views living in ghetto-ized paragraphs.     

 Also from the US> That is actually kind of the problem with Wikipedia all around in the first place, and that is that popular ideas are not necessarily correct. You can have people posting information about the corruptibility of whatever organization, but then the organization can have its people change the entry the next day.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

  
 This entire dicussion lends a great deal of credibilty to the idea that the left-right spectrum poorly represents political and economic views.  It seems to me that most of the debate below is equivalent to attempting to define the square root of negative 1 with only real numbers at our disposal.  It is painfully obvious that politics is muli-dimensional.  The most that can be hoped for here is to describe how the left-right spectrum is used and leave it at that.  This should probably be a very short article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 == Better Chart == 

 I think that this page needs a metter chart. Like this one http://studentnewsdaily.com/conservative_vs_liberal_beliefs.shtml    

  
 Edit  

 I actually think that the article, in fact the whole political movement, needs a better definition of """"left-right"""". Most political parties cannot adhere to a single category, including revolutionnary movements and far-right groups, as described somewhere else in the discussion. 

 I suggest a new use of the """"left-right"""" compass. 

 The political compass uses the """"square"""" system with two axis  x and y (social and économic), which is not very accurate because I know my political ideas, and they tend to be pretty nearer to Mussolini than to Gandhi. Whatever. 

 What I suggest is a cube! 

 3 axis  x, y and z 

 Économic 
 Social 
 Politic 

 The first one defines the market system (if any) of a political group. 
 The second defines the social standing of a political group about the welfare of the people (welfare checks/charity, private/public school/medical system, etc) 
 The thirds one is, basically, the way a society treats it's people (rehabilitation/punishment, democracy/totaliratism (in which I include Soviet Communism!) etc)

Does that reduce my credibility, probably yes ha?). I am sory to give this description but I get the impression that i will soon be blamed of beeing a Turkish propagandist, goverment person, racist whatever. Am I too sensitive. No take a look at the discussion history and see that these accusations are there.    
 I am making clear points that any sane unbiased human cam make. First of all the article issues the Genocide as a fact! A fact but with still some discussions (most of them being from the Turkish goverment). This gives the inevitible impression that all issiue is largely accepted(final verdict). Yet it is not!!!  
 Secondly the term Genocide can only be used under certain conditions (as in the holocoust). in this case there is a real doubt if these conditions are met!!! still the article freely and carelessly uses the term just only because some people or countries recogonise it that way. Do we have the right to blame a nation with this ultimate crime just because of that??? Genocide guys this is no joke!!! tell it 100 times for 90 years and Turks are Genociders! Cool! 
 third: after building up the genocide idea The article mainly represents the opposing view as the view of the Turkish goverment as clearly described by the headings (the position of Turkey,the position of Turkish authorities, political issues) as well as the content. which inevitibly gives the impression that the opposing view is just bull S*** Turkish propaganda. But it is not! Many Prof. and researcher of the era say that it is not. (As seen in the attached letter). yet fadix wrote that these prof were actually accepting the genocide they were fooled in to this (quoting Israel Charny). this is ridiculous. I dont know who the hell is Israel Charny or he really claims something like that. But please we are not stupid people. this was a letter to the representatives and these people who signed it are Profs. for gods sake!!! also If these prof were in favor of the genocide and really fooled in this conspiracy later they would have said """"ok guys I am misslead and fooled into this"""" and this would be the ultimate tool for Armenian side too ridicule and discredit the Turkish side. Is it the case? No!(so fadix what about credibility) 

 I am not bitching anyone. I am not using citations and names to blurr peoples mind. if you read my previous adds you will see that i am trying to use a carefull language. I am sorry again if I used harsh words. But after reading the long history of discussion in this page I have the impression that Fadix (who seems to be the main edittor in this page)has a certain attitude towards the issue and despite serious oppsition now and in the past he is just pushing the article his way.  

 ok Fadix I believe in your good faith. I am a dumb ass who doesnt know any thing about history .please give me answers. I am just asking plain, crystal clear questions. I dont want to hear citations, dates and historian names. just logical anwers!! Just logical answers which will show that you are unbiased!!! Or you may choose to say I believe in Armenian genocide and that is why I chose to ignore... 

 1. how can you use the nomenclature or lets say the word """"genocide"""" so easily knowing that it is desribed and only can be declared by international law. also knowing that there is robust objections to the usage of this term. Are you the ultimate expert. Are you the head of an international court?(if yes where is self defence?)  ((you say Go try finding such a section in the Cambodian genocide article, the Nanking massacre article, Rwanda genocide article. I could not see a Cambodian genocide article, in Rwanda genocide: United Nations set up the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, so the guild is described by law. Nanking massacre is a perfect example!!! why is it not called a genocide but massacre? is it because the guilt is not described by law??!! and in the discussion there is no real objection to the issue accept the numbers) 

 2. why does the article present the genocide as a fact? (I hope you wont tell that it doesnt). why do you build up the article so that people are first instructed that there is indeed a genocide and only later show the objetions.

 == Revision of a paragraph in mind-body section == 

 The following paragraph appears in the section on mind-body problem 
 ::Incompatibilism requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Although  substance dualism offers such a distinction, a less extreme form of naturalism known as non-reductive physicalism may also suffice. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states correspond to neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, although physical states do cause mental states, they are not ontologically reducible to them. In one such construction, mental events supervene on physical events, describing the emergence of mental properties as correspondent to physical properties. This relationship is known as causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as property dualism rather than monism, yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states - such as epiphenomenalism. 

 I understand the urge to recast the preceding discussion in a form more similar to the rest of the article. But I don't find this paragraph, although superior to its predecessor, has quite made the grade. I'd like to try to do this in a manner reverse to that of the paragraph; that is, go from the simple viewpoint to the technical rather than vice versa. A single paragraph won't do it. Here is a possible substitute (please take it as a suggestion to be tinkered with): 
 ::One may choose as a starting point the point of view that mind and matter constitute different things. One may then take several views about how or even whether they interact. At one extreme there is no interaction at all. At another extreme, mind completely controls matter or the other way around. In between, one may say mind and matter each influence each other to a degree, in some cases one is more in control and sometimes the other. 
 ::We might attempt to establish which of these choices is best, but that seems to be out of reach at the moment. Instead, we will simply connect these possibilities with various identifying labels of historical importance.  If one takes the extreme view that mind completely controls matter, or vice versa, in effect the controlled aspect is simply an appendage of the controlling aspect, and may be considered simply as a property of the controlling aspect. The two substances are then simply one, albeit perhaps with some additional attributes, and this viewpoint is called monism, which takes on several forms as described in that Wikipedia article.  
 ::An example, is epiphenomenalism, that mind is just a peculiar side effect of matter. Thomas Huxley described the relation between mind and matter as follows: 
 :: 
 ::Huxley goes on to say he sees no difference from humans in this regard. Very similar to this point of view is reductive physicalism adopted by some neuroscientists: 
 ::{{quote|...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells... |Eric R. Kandel|In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind}} 
 ::The view that mind and matter are different is called dualism, and it again takes on several forms described in that Wikipedia article. Within this description are various degrees of control of one entity over the other, ranging from complete autonomy of one or both entities, to some degree of interdependence. Considerable interest attaches as to what forms of interdependence might arise. 
 ::For example, even if mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states bear some correspondence with neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, physical states do cause'' mental states, but they are not ontologically reducible to them. In one such construction, mental events exhibit emergence from physical propertie",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I was asked to come back and reconsider - There have been edits additions from   - it still looks like an attack story, it looks more like an attack story after the  changes - I can not change my position to require removal from publication    

 ==  Calling the First Minister an Arsehole == 

 I put the story back ,the truth hurts ? I guess you need £ 8,000 really badly 

 I have now put it back again and will continue to do so every time you remobve it 

 You need to try and understand that the wikipedia entry is public property ,you don't own it . 

 :I really don't care about this truth, in fact I agree completely with Mike Daily. You  need to understand that this wiki has rules and you are not following them. FYI I wouldn't qualify FOR THE 8000 euro minimum wage    

 you may not care about the truth ,some of us do

 == Religion == 	   

 One thing which I have heard numerous times and which is not explicitely stated in the article is that the US """"way of living"""" religion is often seen as Freedom of religion, but not freedom from religion: one can chose any religion he wants (preferably a variant of Christianism  and preferably a variant of protestantism if one wants to have fair chances to obtain high positions), but atheism, or even agnosticism, are not well tolerated. 	   
  	   
 This is especially observable when wealthy evangelists from the USA go on their """"evangelisation"""" trip to Europe and start talking about religion to people in the streets, a subject widely regarded as very personal. 	   
  	   
 I don't know how this could fit in the article though (I'd rather discuss this here before).   	   
  	   
 :Are you American? I ask that because it sounds like you have the common """"I've heard America is this way"""" idea. I'm an American, live in a nice city with many friends in different social classes and with different backgrounds and I would say that religion is totally on the back-burner with people choosing whatever they like and not dropping it on others. I personally feel religion is for the most part a crock, and when I discuss that fact I get a wide variety of replies and thoughts, but nobody is trying to convert me. If I see a televangalist on TV I just turn the channel, no big deal. Now as far as the midwest gos, I can't really speak from experience but my idea is that the US as a Christian fundamentalist factory is WAY overblown in the foreign press. We get sterotyped as a caricature of what we are...like when you get a charcoal sketch of yourself at the beach and the guy draws your ears really big and has your head all mishapen to highlight your features, way overblown! I could say that I don't like all the German shit-porn videos that I know they are really into and that I should include a section on the Germany page about fecal-defecater-porn because it is so prevelant in their society when really that is kind of a personal thing, but I realize that Germany really isn't THAT into filming themselves shit on each other and I know it is an overblown viewpoint of Germans in America. Does that go too far to make a point? Sorry if I offended any Germans, totally for explanation sake ) Anyway, we need a rebuttal section first that highlights the fact that some of this is misconception propogated by ignorance of Americans and religous extremism too   	   
  	   
 ::Rama is perhaps unwittingly revealing a major root of anti-American sentiment abroad. Ignorance.   |   	   
 
 ::: I don't say that this is true exactly the way it is shown on some media. Just that lots of people percieve it this way, and that some traits in American Weltanshaung confort this perception. The """"In God we trust"""", swearing on the Bible, religious proselytism abroad and other punctual details like this can give an overall impression which is the subject of the article.

I just changed the piece on hierocracy, because I've never heard it used as a synonym for theocracy, and it has its own perfectly clear meaning in the work of Weber which has been widely adopted. I suspect that whoever wrote that bit had no idea what he was talking about.  

 I find the whole entry for theocracy completely unsatisfactory, starting with the definition. Again, it reads as if the writers had no idea about the subject and have it confused with several other topics. I think it would be hopeless to try to repair the page by successive edits. It needs to start with a proper definition of theocracy that distinguishes theocracy from caesaropapism and clearly says that a pious society is NOT by definition a theocracy, and also that church establishment is not compatible with theocracy, but is compatible with caesaropapism. Theocracy is a form of government, not a social quality, it can be defined as """" """"a government in which the persons and institutions of the religious order either control or replace the organs of the civil government."""" (Sen McGlinn, Church and State, page 243).  

 Then it is clear that Iran is a theocracy, Saudi Arabia is not, and so on through all the other questions discussed here. The problem is a vague and too broad definition at the outset. One should rather start with a clear and hard definition, and later note that in popular usage the term has become an almost meaningless pejoritive applied to religion in public places.  

 Can somebody enlighten me about how one goes about fixing the page? One obvious step would be to ask for input via the editors of the Journal of Church and State (Baylor University, they have a research school on this topic). Email me at Sen.sonja [at] Casema.NL - Sen McGlinn ]]

 ::I am not asking that the article itself draw any conclusions, and the rest of your remarks are exactly the kind of synthesis that I desire. My remarks are meant to move us past the conflict on the talk page. Our sources are, of course, the verifiable secondary sources, and we are not to do original research. As CTSWynekan has said, Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Frankly, it's enough for me that the various Christian views are presented fairly and accurately, the various Jewish views are presented fairly and accurately, the various historical views (whether by specialists or nonspecialists) are presented fairly and accurately, and all other views are presented fairly and accurately. All should be given the appropriate weight and context. That is enough of a synthesis for me.  
 ::But, we all have our subjective views, and many of our views have clashed, hence we have been bogged down in one paragraph for far too long. What bothers me is the binary thinking evidenced by some (many, not all), which has polarized the debate. We should also, of course, be sure not to confuse our various subjective viewpoints with the objective actual, verifiable and factual (as someone once said). So in the end, I essentially agree with you. My remarks on thesis-antithesis-synthesis and the rest have to do with the debate on this page, not with the article itself. I want us to move past conflict so we can examine the verifiable sources, and put aside our own views while still making sure that we (any """"we"""") are accurately represented, as are the views of others. To paraphrase Ross Perot, everybody stop fighting and get to work! If you'll check you'll notice that I've done very little work on the article itself; most of my efforts have been focused on the talk page. 
 ::NPOV (when we reach it) will be a synthesis accurately reporting the views of all, and referenced to the appropriate verifiable sources.That said, I have been as frustrated as anyone else and needed to vent my spleen (which perhaps presented my POV more strongly than I have in the past. Does that make it trinary?). My spleen has been vented. My comments will remain on my user page at least until we formulate a second paragraph that does exactly as you say, and is accepted by all. It may go back if we run into further unresolved conflict.

 == Why is this article not called """"Republic of China""""? == 

 In the Macedonia name dispute a vote was taken that ignored the provisional UN name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The rationale given for this is that Wikipedia does not conform to international bodies and that self-determination of name trumps regardless of international disputes between states. Ergo - why are the people of the Republic of China held to a different standard? This inconsistent logic smells of prejudice towards either  the people of Taiwan and/or the people of Greece. I therefore propose that this article be renamed Republic of China to keep things consistent.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

  
 A few points I'd like to add. 

 # The People's Republic of China recognizes the self-determined name of Republic of Macedonia. 
 # The People's Republic of China does not recognize the self-determination of the Republic of China (Taiwan). 
 # The US government, did not recognize Republic of Macedonia in 1944 (the US state department at the time calling it """"communist demagoguery"""") but flip flopped in 2003 and now recognizes it. 
 # The US government, orginally did recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan)  right up until it flip-flopped and removed recognition in the 1970s. 

 This opens up the secondary question is Wikipedia taking a principled approach on international issues or simply parroting the current foreign policy of leading nations? (i.e. mob rule)  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 : For the reasons given here: Talk:Taiwan/Archive 20. A lot of discussion so a lot of reading, but if you're interested in the issue I think well worth reading at least the highlights of it.  

 :: For the same reason that we have North Korea not the 'Democratic People Republic of Korea' and we have Burma not the 'Republic of the Union of Myanmar'. It is policy to use the common English name. Not the official name; not the UN designated name; not the preferred name of the local people; but the common name as used by English speaking people to describe the subject. See WP:Naming Conventions for more information about how article names are decided on Wikipedia.    

 ::: Naming this article 'Taiwan' does not contribute clarity. Titling the article 'Taiwan' may lead the reader to belief that such a country as 'Taiwan' exists, or that 'Taiwan' can be equated to the 'Republic of China', which are both invalid arguments in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China. The fact is that no country called 'Taiwan' exists, and that the 'Republic of China' cannot be casually associated with 'Taiwan' as historically they are very distinct entities. It also contravenes the rules for Wikipedia's neutral POV rules, as it promotes the DPP's assertion that Taiwan should edge toward independence by increasing the usage of 'Taiwan' without officially abandoning the 'Republic of China' name. It is for the sake of objectiveness that the official name should be used. See: WP:Neutral point of view   
 ::::Again see the requested move, where this was debated in long detail to arrive at the current title, best representing consensus and common usage. The article is Taiwan reflecting the common name for the country.  

 :::::Thank you  for your clarification on this matter. I agree that this article should be named Taiwan for the sake of clarity to English speakers in Wikipedia. However, I believe that it should be made clearer that the Republic of China is not equivalent to Taiwan.

 ==The accusations have profoundly effected his life, therefore are notable and deserve inclusion.== 
 The facts have moved past debating whether there really is a love affair or a love child, its on to how this is hurting John Edwards. I guess someone researching him would just have to wonder why his political career suddenly sputtered the summer of 2008, wiki won't mention what everyone else is writing long stories about. 

 Its probably ended his career in politics. Whether the story is true or false or not is debatable, and it doesn't matter if you don't like the original source, leftist wiki editors protecting Edwards: the story now is how the allegations are damaging him and have already probably lost him any chance at his best chance at furthering his career: the VP slot. Its an important story, its an important fact that his behaviour has caused a firestorm. Suppressing the story _completely_ is making wikipedia a laughing stock. Gawker, Mickey Kaus, countless bloggers are going on about it and pointing to it as proof of wiki's leftist bias. You aren't really hiding anything anyone doesn't know already, and you're making the site you claim to be protecting look stupid.  

 Its noteworthy, very much so. Its verifiable that the scandal, true or false, is affecting his career (many people have been hurt by scandals that turned out to be false, that doesn't make the news of the damage any less noteworthy). It has innumerable sources as to the effect on Edwards' career. Its time to lift the blackout and start debating on the wording of a section about it. You can't avoid it forever. Are you just trying to bluff it out until the election is over in hopes of minimizing any tangential damage you think it might cause Obama?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :Is it really a surprise that people are fighting to get the truth posted on Wikipedia? I recently had to deal with the Nazi admins on Wiki and let me tell you, I could honestly say they act like a bunch of kids in the movie """"Lord of the Flies"""". The majority of them will not listen to reason and when you present them with facts they disregard them. There is also no one managing this site from the top who gives a crap about what is going on here. The only way the owners of Wikipedia will challenge a Nazi admin is when it involves legal action. Wikipedia is the anti-Christ of the internet. Also a majority of the Nazi admins are liberals and the only way to become an admin is to be voted in by another liberal Nazi admin. Once again, """"Lord of the Flies"""". Just wait and see. I will be hounded by many of them for posting just this little snippet. Its pretty much a given. They will probably ban my IP or kick me off the site for a few days. If they dont like what you are saying, that is what they do. They pretty much do what they want. Pretty pathetic.    

 :: It is obvious that there is a calculated effort by the mainstream media (MSM) to suppress any information about this story. The MSM has jumped on stories with much less to go on than this Edwards story. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the MSM, and the liberal websites like Wikipedia, won’t talk about the bad things that happen in the Democrat party because it is the party and ideals that they personally believe in. It is human nature to not attack yourself and the Democrats will not attack themselves by talking about Edwards cheating on his wife who is dying of cancer. This is a silver bullet for the Democratic Party especially because there is a presidential race going on. Why do you think the MSM sits on stories until months or weeks before an actual election takes place? It is a new phenomena occurring in the MSM where they run a story with little facts in an effort to smear a person (typically a politician) then they let the people decide if they want to believe it. This usually occurs with little or if any facts to back it up. All the major networks do it all the time. A perfect example is the Dan Rather forged documents story about President Bush. They unleashed the story with little to no facts right before a Presidential election. It’s very sad that more of the American people don’t see what the MSM to trying to pull off right in front of their eyes. I am not an avid listener of Rush but I have caught him a few times and there is absolute truth to the term he uses when referring to the MSM, """"Drive-by Media"""".

 ::: Firstly, it must be noted that there has been compromise, and that several of the suggestions have been incorporated. 

 As to the remainder, the overriding problem is the casual language. Fragments such as: 

 """"Louis narrates how he reached this point"""" is clunky and less formal than the more appropriate In a  flashback, Louis reveals in narration the circumstances of his imprisonment. 

 This is minor, but Louis' mother is forced to take a boarder - more accurate than """"humbles herself"""" which is also clunky. 

 """"Unimpressed by his prospects, Sibella turns down his proposal and instead marries Lionel (John Penrose)"""" is firstly an assumption and casual (ie. """"turns down""""). This: After being rebuked by an now adult Sibella and witnessing her marriage to Lionel (John Penrose) is more formal and 100% accurate. 

 """"At his workplace, Louis has to wait upon"""" is clumsy, but there can be a modification that incorporates the best of both.  """"A darkroom explosion makes her a widow"""" is simply unnecessary and casual in tone. This can also be modified. You've also missed the viewing of the remaining family at the church.

 The  Holocaust  

 The holocaust occurred during World War II when Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany. The holocaust is basically when millions of Jews were murdered during WWII and were intensely discriminated by Hitler and the Nazi’s. However many of the Jews had resided in parts of Europe and many of them were residing in Germany but many of them were once again murdered by the Germans because Hitler plotted on disappearing all the Jews that were in the country.  This reminds me of how Ms. Gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the Holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event. But some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did.  

 Therefore, a network of over 40,000 facilities in Germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate, hold and kill Jews and other victims. In addition after the beginning of WWII, the Nazi’s began ordering Jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them weren't allowed to leave at all. Also many of the Jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the Nazis or they will have to face death, but the Jews faced death anyways and about 5 million children were also killed during the holocaust due to Hitler’s orders. Also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than 5 million non-Jewish victims living in Germany during WWII and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas. In addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos, concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the Jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps, and the majority of all Jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they weren't respected and treated kindly by the Germans and especially Hitler. Also the Jews were the scapegoats of Germany collapsing after WWI meaning that the Nazi’s blame the Jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and Germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country. 

 Anne Frank Diary 

 Anne Frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the Holocaust. She was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary. I believe that she had a messenger, to tell her what was going on outside. Anne Frank was born in June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany. She was born as a Jew, and bringing a Jew was a very bad thing in the 1920’s because it was during World War I. She was hiding because herself and her family didn't want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place. I don’t understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family, that didn't do anything wrong? Why hurt the Jews? What did they do to get killed? 

 Change of the Freedom Writers 

 Should It’s amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded. From a group of students who didn't care about school and becoming someone important in life, to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same. Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story. They didn't care about school; they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed. Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach. Many of them graduated from colleges, others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation. They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School. The reason why, is because it was then when it all started. From failing, ditching class, gang violence, poverty, and other domestic violence at home, to SUCCESS. For the most part, most of them are doing very well. They are teachers, professors and other important positions someone can have. They are living the toast of change.

 == Sleeper (Woody Allen film) == 

 In view of its creator and star, Woody Allen, the movie Sleeper is satire of trends of the 1970s placed in a futuristic setting. I'm giving as an anachronism a reference to a historical event (the abandonment of clerical celibacy by the Roman Catholic Church) in which a character finds a 1990 newspaper that refers to the """"wife of the Pope"""" having children. Such would not happen for at least 24 years after the time suggested in the newspaper.   

 Nobody says that this movie is orthodox science fiction (note that tobacco and junk food have been found wholesome and organic foods have been found harmful in an Orwellian world), but a reference to a 1990 event that is shown to be impossible because a prediction of an institutional change that does not happen for a significant time later becomes an anachronism after 1991.

 == Thanks == 

 Hi Pburka. You don't know me but I just wanted to say thank you for this comment you made at AN/EW regarding 155blue's edit warring report against me (for edits on my own talk page). Believe it or not, she also reported my supposed edit warring at the vandalism noticeboard, which of course was quickly dumped. She has apparently been educated several times about what vandalism is, but she continues to falsely accuse (and report) other editors of it. And she ignored me when I educated her about WP:3RR and WP:NOT3RR. I see that she also issued you a bogus warning just above this thread (without a signature, yet again). She doesn't know the difference between WP:PROD and WP:AFD, which doesn't surprise me because she warned me about moving a """"warning"""" - on my own talk page, no less - that was actually a template. The most concerning issue, though, is that she only has 300 or so edits - most of them in the past four months - and has shown a pattern of of rashly issuing warnings to, and filing reports at various noticeboards about, editors. Even very experienced ones, like yourself. This pattern of hers seems to indicate that she prefers to go straight to noticeboards instead of having proper discussions with editors first, even though some of the editors are vastly more experienced than her and the allegations are flawed. Anyway, just wanted to say thanks for the very on-point comment you made.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In fact in the republic model rejected in 1999, the President would have been selected by the Prime Minister, which is exactly what happens now with the selection of the Governor-General. There was to be a nominations committee, but that was to meet in secret and its recommendations were not binding on the Prime Minister - he could have nominated whoever he wanted and if the disgruntled members of the committee complained that this wasn't their nomination, they would have been guilty of an offence. As it stands in Australia, the leader of the majority party or coalition selects the head of state.

00c046cb3a07cd38,"A few questions that need resolving regarding this article 

 1) Why the inclusion of the actions of individuals? Surely the point of corporate behaviour is that it is the action of a corporation in itself, although these actions may not always be the intended ourcome of any individuals involved. Furthermore whilst the effects of corporate behaviour on individuals may be a useful sociological side effect I do not see this as central to the issue of corporate behaviour. 

 2) I think an explicit division needs to be made between business/capitalist corporations and noncapitalist corporations (NGOs, charities etc) as I think the proposed rules of corporate behaviour can only be seen to apply to capitalist corporations. 

 If no-one disagrees with this would people like me to attempt these changes (removal of references to indiviudals, creation of distinction between business and non-business coporations)?

 :Making Up Meanings in a Capital City: Power, Memory and Monuments in Berlin (from [13]) - states """"... heavy weapons, has historically received rather more attention from the local population, attracting the epithet ‘tomb of the unknown rapist’ or ‘tomb of ...""""  one can assume (i.e. engage in original research) that this is referring to a monument in Berlin, and even if one was to assume correctly it was talking about a monument in Berlin, there are THREE Soviet war memorials in Berlin, and as there are also other War Memorials in Berlin (US, UK, etc), it is original research to link it to this memorial and as per the first ref above, I will continue to dispute it's inclusion in this article, again as a violation of WP:OR. 

 :Again, as this is obviously a fringe term, evident by the non-existence of sources, one of which is a joke book, and also because one of those sources claims that a Soviet war memorial in the British sector also has this """"nickname"""" (this of course being Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten), as it is in the former British sector of Berlin), there is enough concern as to editors using Google searches as a means of adding unverified information into articles, that it is in the best interests of this article to remove those sources. Remember, the WP:BURDEN is on editors inserting material into articles to verify information, and as clearly laid out above, it is impossible that the editors have verified it before inserting into the article; otherwise the requested cites would have been forthcoming

 Juror #3 said, """"But it's someone else's life, and if I'm wrong and I kill someone else  I can't live with that."""" The suggests that the jury may have held a misunderstanding. In Florida, a jury is able to recommended a life sentence instead of death. A reporter on AC360 had a similar impression, saying, """"Did the jury really understand their role?"""" and suggested the judge may have been at fault. This alone may not warrant inclusion in the article, but more substantive references to this issue may be out there.    
 :It would probably be OR to make such an assertion right now based on that statement.  More indepth interviews may take place in the future.    
 :::This should have been a bench trial. The jurors clearly did not understand the law.  It is complicated in a circumstantial case.  I also think that a death penalty case is always a difficult case for jurors to decide.    
 ::::Trial by jury is a right; given the facts of this case and the prosecution putting the death penalty on the table, it would have been foolish for the defense team to ask for a bench trial.    
 :::::That is not what I meant. If my life were hanging in the balance, I would much rather put it in the hands of a judge. This should never have been a death penalty case.  Not enough evidence to meet the criteria.  A jury is too unpredictable.  Most of the time, the defense team thinks about how much money they will make and the publicity they will get - which is also about money, and lastly, they think about the defendant.  To the prosecution and the judge, it is about the truth and the proof.  Of course the defense team would not want a bench trial.     
 ::::::It would be best if we stay on topic then as our common goal here is to improve the article; opinions that you'd rather face a judge yourself, or that the jurors didn't understand the law in this case, or that most defense lawyers put their clients last to focus on fame while for prosecutors its about """"the truth"""" isn't constructive on article talk pages.

 Is there a Florida law that could counter the verdict (guilty, not guilty) if it is found that the jurors did not follow the jury instructions? On Nancy Grace there was mention of """"jury fraud""""; the only example given was that if it was proven that their decision was based on what the bible says is right/wrong. Jennifer Ford clearly didn't understand that this was the """"guilt phase"""" and not the """"penalty phase""""; furthermore, there were plenty of other degree-options surrounding the murder charge that would not have inflicted the death penalty for which she couldn't live with.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :With all due respect to Nancy Grace, there isn't a chance in H*** that will happen.  The law of Double Jeopardy will prevent her of ever being criminally tried to these offences again.  She could be sued in civil court for wrongful death for money (like OJ was) but her parents seem to be delighted that she was found not guilty so I doubt that would happen.

U zadnjem povratu si mi i izbrisao link na rezultate općinskih izbora iz 1990! Da li ti uopće čitaš te promjene? U cijeloj diskusiji mi nisi dao niti jedan jedini argument da moje promjene ne stoje. Po čemu sam ja odbacio sud u Hagu? Po čemu i jedna moja promjena niječe bilo što izrečeno na Haškom sudu? Za Blaškićevu presudu nisam nigdje rekao(ajde pročitaj još jedamput moje riječi!) da nije bilo zločina u Ahmićima, niti sam na nijedan način uopće spomenuo ulogu RH u cijelom sukobu. Rekao sam da se držiš izjava iz Haga bez da ih dokazuješ. Bilo je žalbi u kojima su prijašnje osude odbačene. Npr. Kupreškići. Ali sve od toga je totalno ne bitno za moje promjene! Ima 5 stvari koje uporno briseš(po 555put) 
 1) HDZ je pobjedio u većini općina koje je htio uključiti u HB (imaš rezultat izbora na linku) 
 2) za odcjepljenje i organiziranje nove vlasti je krivio neučinkovist vlasti u Sarajevu. U čemu je problem? Koja nova vlast (pogotovo ako je pučistička) ne krivi staru za sve probleme??? 
 3) HB je proglašena republikom za vrijeme Ženevskih pregovora u kojima se raspravljalo o podjeli BiH na 3 etničke republike. Plan Owen-Stoltenberg? Zar bi svaki pojedini pojam morao imati neki link? (a i linkovi koje sam ti dostavio očito nisu prekorisni jer kada si me tražio rezultate izbora, kasnije si tako i tako izbrisao rečenicu i rekao da rezultatiuopće nisu bitni (zašto si me onda tražio izvore???)) 
 4)priče o početku rata. Rat se rasplamsao nakon što je Travnički kanton dodijeljen Hrvatima i HVO pokušao očistiti A BiH iz njega, tj sukobi oko zajedničkih vojnih snaga (wance-owenow plan) 
 5)oko upotrebe simbola i novca. Na sve te simbole Hrvati su imali pravo kao konstruktivni narod, a što se novca tiče, glavna valuta je tijekom rata bila njemačka marka. Siljenje učenika drugih naroda da se pridržavaju hrvatskog kurikuluma je protuustavno, ali nisam imao vremena da to pravilno formuliram. 
 Nijedna od ovih stvari nije išla na štetu niti bosanske vlasti niti u opravdavanje HBa. Sve stvari opisuju stanje kakvo je bilo na području HBa, od naseljavanja izbjeglica pa na dalje. Jedina stvar koja bi eventualno mogla biti sporna je dio o 'hrvatskom strahu' ali to također još nema ispravnu formulaciju. Svaka promjena je u skladu s NPOV wikipedinom politikom, a ne vidim zašto bi za svaku od ovih stvari morao postojati konkretan link! Minimalno 10 puta sam te pozvao da mi pomogneš oko formulacije svake od navedenih stvari umjesto da ih samo obrišeš! O kakvom doljevanju ulja na vatru govoriš? Ajde daj pročitaj još jedanput NPOV politiku [], da li u njoj piše da smiješ citirati tuđe mišljenje, bez da se slažeš s njime???  Dio sa generalizacijom hrvatskog mišljenja je možda moja greška, ali nikako ne uspjevam naći ispravnu formulaciju za situaciju u kojoj 80-90% biračkog tijela bira pripadnike jedne stranke čije je službeno mišljenje takvo i takvo! Prepucavanje i flip-flop oko neke stranice ne vodi apsolutno ničemu, a pogotovo ne koristi wikipedije. Mislim, koja ti je stvar vraćati sve na staro usprkos svakom dokazu? Na samom početku diskusije si me tražio izvore za rezultate izbora 1990, ja ti ih pošaljem, a ti svejedno izbrišeš rečenicu za koju si tražio potkrijepu?? Ajde molim te probaj malo to pročitati i razmisliti o svemu rečenomu. Niti jedna od mojih namjera nije bila loša niti služi za nametanje tuđeg mišljenja, niti opravdanju HBa(milijunti put!) već proširenju konteksta. I ne shvaćam zašto pričaš o izjavama iz bosanskih medija, niti kako bi nešto bilo drugačije da navedeš, makar kao izvor neku od tih izjava. Koja je razlika između rečenice 'the Herzeg-Bosnian leadership is presently awaiting trial at the ICTY on charges including Crimes Against Humanity' i navođenja konkretne optužbe za zločin? Svaki zločin bez obzira na nacionalnost treba biti kažnjen. Zar su crvena krvna zrnaca nekog zato što je jedne nacionalnosti imuna na ratne zločine??

 ==Problem with Millenium Shakespeare article== 
 The title of the article is misspelled indeed, but as a new user I couldn't edit it myself, neither redirect the older article with the correct name to lead to the new version of the text. I would appreciate any hints on how to deal with that. Also, I don't see where is the conflist of interest in the article. Give me some hints. Thanks!  
    

  
 ==The Sickness (on Lost)== 

 I mentioned it on my message that you left, and think we should put it on the DISCUSSION page for anyone else to chime in on.  As said in that previous message, I think that in fictional cases, we have more leeway to speculate on stuff, especialy when we are talking about LOST where answers are few and far between and often provide us asking more questions.    

 ==Randall Flagg== 
 Take out the picture of King instead. A picture of the character seems more relevant than his creator, especially seeing that as of now, there are two images of him from the books, two from TV, one of King, and none from the comics.    

 :My image qualm doesn't stop with Palpatine and Jabba. Those are older FAs that were established before the rigorous overhaul of fair use images in articles. Per the actual criteria, you need to have something about the image beyond simple identification (the only exclusion to that is the infobox image). My fear with the article in FAC is that criticism will arise about how influential this character is King's novels, yet how slim the article is on information about him. If you feel it is ready, then go for it. The worst that can happen is that it is not promoted, in which case you will most likely have a lot more eyes telling you what you can do to improve it, thus making it that much better. There is no draw back to not getting promoted other than not getting that little bronze star. D

 == Dark Tower WP discussion == 

 Greetings Dark Tower WikiProject member, I would like to invite you to palaver about a possible expansion of the Dark Tower Project to include all Stephen King related items. I feel that the large amount of projects related to the author warrants his own Project—but as this one already exists—hesitate to begin a new one. Please feel free to leave comments of any kind and be assured that The Dark Tower will be held in the highest regard within the new King Project. Long days and pleasant nights.   

 == Saw traps == 

 From what I remember of the list, it was just that a list of the traps. There wasn't much there but original research and personal observation about each of the traps - which is probably why it got deleted, and rightly so. If there was real content there, then that's another story, but I doubt that content couldn't be found on the individual film pages. But, if you feel that it was wrongly deleted, then I'd go to the deletion review page and start the discussion. Maybe the closing Admin was a little hasty in his decision making.

 == I am retiring from WP, but please apologize for the false allegation of personal attack, I have evidence refuting it == 

 I have decided to retire from Wikipedia because of administrators' mishandling of the report I put in, in which I took most of the blame for accusations that are false. Drmies, you accused be of personal attack after I stated to Lihaas that I had nothing in common with him because of his stated association with fascism and National Socialism that I refer to as """"Nazism"""" as it is on Wikipedia. Now you and others claim that maybe he is misrepresenting himself - that he meant to say that he is a """"democratic nationalist socialist"""" - - first of all he states on his user page that he is a fascist - and bear in mind that National Socialism as on Wikipedia and in many scholarly works is recognized as a form of fascism. If there is any question as to whether I falsely claimed he was a fascist and Nazi (in the sense of the broader """"National Socialism"""") - look at this userbox on his page: 

  
 The infoboxes repeatedly state """"National Socialist"""" as """"NS"""" on multiple infoboxes. He also has other infoboxes that support far-right ultranationalist political parties- that indicate even further that he is aligned with fascism and National Socialism (as in Nazism), such as: 
  - Jobbik is a far right Hungarian ultranationalist movement with a paramilitary movement called Magyar Gárda (Hungarian Guard) - it is anti-Semitic - it accuses Israel of """"buying up"""" Hungary and its paramilitary group attacks Romani (Gypsy) people. 

  - Ataka - Greek short form for National Union Attack - far-right Bulgarian nationalist movement - acknowledged by all parliamentary parties as a xenophobic movement and a national threat to Bulgaria's ethnic minorities, it known for hate speech, the Ataka's leader's son sent an anti-Romani email to members of the European Parliament - sniding that Hungary is """"full"""" of Romani. 
  L.A.O.S. short form for Popular Orthodox Rally - a far-right Greek nationalist movement - it opposes any immigration from outside the European Union 
 
 True, he has contradictory userboxes - it may mean he is politically confused or has mixed opinions. Bottom line, from the statements of his userboxes, he is not merely a nationalistic socialist, his userboxes make clear that he is a fascist National Socialist and that he supports multiple far-right ultranationalist political parties - two of which have promoted xenophobia towards ethnic minorities - Jobbik towards Jews and Romani, and Ataka towards Romani. When Lihaas started confronting me, I stated on Lihaas' userpage that I fundamentally opposed his views and do not want to associate with him or talk with him because of those views - that is my choice and my right not to be forced to accept unwanted postings on my talk page. I don't care whether he wants to keep them or not, I think he has the right of personal liberty to post his political views - but he should not expect everyone to respect his stated support of fascism, National Socialism, and far-right ultranationalist movements - as I said, I do not want to talk with a person who adheres to such views.  

 I am preparing my final retirement from Wikipedia so please respond here, but I want an apology for administrators' mishandling of this, I was honest and stating what he himself posted on his user page when I said he was a fascist and a Nazi, his userpage says that he """"is a Fascist"""" and that he """"is a National Socialist"""" and his support of Jobbik and other far-right ultranationalist parties - just put those together in your mind and take note where the term National Socialism redirects to on Wikipedia: Nazism - and I referred to Nazism in its general form of an ideology and its continuation in a general form as neo-Nazism. Lihaas may claim that he does not support German Nazism, but when I first noticed these tendencies on his talk page - I noticed the anti-Romani, anti-Semitic Jobbik movement first of all, then looked on and saw the other two infoboxes I mentioned - all the same - I do not want to talk with someone who supports far-right ultranationalist movements that promote xenophobia - that is my choice not to talk to the person and my right not to have the person talk to me after I have told them not to.

 == Revision of lede == 

 I've put together a draft revision of the article's lede. 

 ===Current revision=== 

 Here's the current revision of the lede (2011-12-24, 14:30) for reference: 

  
 :Global warming refers to the rising average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans and its projected continuation. In the last 100 years, Earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F) with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.[2] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are more than 90% certain most of it is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels.[3][4][5][6] These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized countries.[7][A] 

 :Climate model projections are summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They indicate that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 1.1 to 2.9 °C (2 to 5.2 °F) for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.4 to 6.4 °C (4.3 to 11.5 °F) for their highest.[8] The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations.[9][10] 

 :An increase in global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, and a probable expansion of subtropical deserts.[11] Warming is expected to be strongest in the Arctic and would be associated with continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Other likely effects of the warming include more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events, species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes, and changes in agricultural yields. Warming and related changes will vary from region to region around the globe, with projections being more robust in some areas than others.[12] In a 4 °C world, the limits for human adaptation are likely to be exceeded in many parts of the world, while the limits for adaptation for natural systems would largely be exceeded throughout the world. Hence, the ecosystem services upon which human livelihoods depend would not be preserved.[13] 

 :Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),[14] whose ultimate objective is to prevent """"dangerous"""" anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) climate change.[15] Parties to the UNFCCC have adopted a range of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions[16]:10[17][18][19]:9 and to assist in adaptation to global warming.[16]:13[19]:10[20][21] Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required,[22] and that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-industrial level.[22][B] Analyses by the United Nations Environment Programme (published in 2011)[23] and International Energy Agency (2011)[24] suggest that current efforts to reduce emissions may be inadequately stringent to meet the UNFCCC's 2 °C target. 

  
 I have some problems with this revision. In my opinion, parts of it are too long, too technical/jargony, confusing, or imprecise/vague. 

 ===Suggested revision=== 

 Cited sources are given later on in the references section. If other editors agree with parts of my suggested revision, I'll change the references to make them consistent with the rest of the article: 

  
 :Global warming refers to the rising average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans and its projected continuation. In the last 100 years, Earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F) with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.[2] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and is evident from observations of increases in global air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level (IPCC, 2007d, SYR 6.1 Observed changes in climate and their effects, and their causes). 

 :Since the start of the industrial revolution in 1750, human activities have lead to an increase in the concentration of heat-trapping """"greenhouse"""" gases in the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels, but also through changes in land use, such as deforestation (Denman, et al, 2007, FAQ 7.1 ﻿﻿Are the Increases in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases During the Industrial Era Caused by Human Activities?﻿). Scientists are more than 90% certain that most of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century was caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (IPCC, 2007d, SPM 2.

 :From Knuth's webpage( http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/faq.html ), it is pronounced Ka-NOOTH. Someone should add that to the article ... Not sure how phonetics work in Wikipedia.

 :::Well, Permyakia and Perm Oblast have established economic ties and a lot of common infrastructure—that's one of the main reasons.  Also, Permyakia is heavily dotational, relying on the federal transfers to form a significant portion of its budget.  Problem is, federal government is not always good with transferring funds timely, which, as you imagine, creates all sorts of issues.  Perm Oblast, on the other hand, is a donor, and once both budgets are merged, it will ease the pain somewhat (but note that during 2006 there will still be two separate budgets, so there will be a transitional period).  Another thing—Permyakia will still have a special status within new Perm Krai.  The main scoop is that Permyakia will no longer need to rely on federal government's transfers (but will, of course, become dependent of Perm Krai's budget), and Perm Oblast will gain access to Permyakia's resources.  The merger also lowers administrative costs—instead of two local governments there will only be one.  Considering that Russians and Komi-Permyaks co-existed peacefully for quite some time, there is something in this merger for both parties.

USAID and the EU PHARE project provided counterbalancing advice which took into account the voucher system that had been instituted in Estonia, which was alien to Schmidt's German experience.  Indeed, in opposing the first public offerings for shares, in the manner of Margaret Thatcher's government in Britain, Schmidt commented that such methods equated to the reintroduction of communism.  When majority stakes were sold in former state enterprises according to the classic German method, especially to entities associated with the state enterprises' managers, questions were asked as to whether the majority shareholders were unduly profiting by not treating their part-subsidiaries at arm's length.

 == Question == 

 Is it okay to use letter written from the trenches as a source when writing a wikipedia article.  For example I assume that you could use published letters to verify an oppinion of soldiers during a war, but could you use it as a verifiable source for facts?  Like when published civil war letters state that they are employeeing snipers at a certain battle, would said letter be enough to site it as a fact, or do you need further proof.  Also If the letters ARE NOT published can you use them to show oppinions of soldiers during war.  For example if I have possesion of several letters from the civil war stating that soldiers from the war stated that they dont believe the """"fredom of a few nigers"""" is worth the war, can I thereby state that not all soldiers of the north even agreed with the abolishment of slavery.

 == Norepi makes you think better == 

 I disagreed rather directly to your response to a question at the science reference desk, and decided to send you my reply directly to facilitate dialogue: 

 ::In response to your question specifically, no, being stressed does not make you think better. The Blood brain barrier prevents large molecules in the blood stream from entering the nervous system, protecting it from most infections. Although norepinephrine can be found in the brain and in the body in general, the norepinephrine produced by the adrenal glands doesn't reach the brain. Norepinephrine in the brain is produced by neurons and stays in the brain.  

 ::Besides, think pracitcally: when you're stressed, don't you find that you are more grumpy, unstable and more prone to making bad decisions? Do you personally think that you or those around you """"think better"""" when you're stressed? Faster maybe, but better? 

 ::Moreover, although drugs that boost norepinephrine availability have been useed to treat ADHD, the general idea that having alot of neurotransmitter in general makes you think better is a little confused. Having alot of a neurotransmitter may sound good but it's usually not and often can result in psychiatric disorders of chemical imbalance.

 Tell Tyrone to check his messages. A representative of the Wikimedia Foundation has made an attempt to contact Stephen Colbert through his staff. In the meantime, I'm still gathering more information about the specific linking issue.   (Lee)  
 :That's an edit summary in an admin's block log, not a message sent to anyone in any official capacity  contrary to popular opinion, some Wikipedians do have a sense of humor. The message that was sent to him would represent an attempt to ascertain identity following an established procedure. If Colbert wants to promote his site here, all he needs to do is make a trivial effort to establish his identity to the Foundation, which is already seeking to contact him as we speak. Not that I have anything to do with this, but I thought I might alert you to a simple way around this.   (Lee)  

 :Sheeh. I apologize for not being more clear. I didn't exactly expect you to go searching through miscellaneous site logs when I mentioned that someone from the Foundation was attempting to contact Colbert. The Wikimedia Fountation is, just to clear, the non-profit organization that handles Wikipedia's business and legal affairs. They're seeking to contact him, actually, over events related to the previous night's """"Wikiality"""" discussion on the Report  this is something I heard through the grapevine and not anything I know much about  but I thought perhaps that if this site is indeed a scrappy little underdog of a marketing campaign for book whick Colbert considers his baby, he or a representative might want to bother to have a fifteen minute discussion which would allow tek-related information to happily coexist with Wikipedia's policies. He doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to, but since the folks at the tekjansen site seem to be somewhat preoccupied with the status of a single link here  and have us listed as their top referrer, despite the link being down half the time  I thought the option might be of interest. No, huh?   (Lee)

I'm sorry, but the """"it's relevant anyway"""" angle is fairly weak; the only reason this material would be an especially relevant resource on Colert would be if it was actually Colbert's writing. It does not have information on anything relevant to Stephen's biography. Generally speaking, we don't count fan forums as an invaluable, unique resource  see WP:EL.  That leaves the book, which, while possibly being Colbert's, is irrelevant if it's not. I could write a novel about Charlene and post in on my website, and that would also not be relevant. Or a novel about Stephen Colbert for that matter. In any case, I'm sorry that for some reason I seem to have pissed you off.

 You wrote: 
 :that Judaic sources on Hebrew not claim authoritarian ownership of that language. I would love for you to present the sources you claim contradict the Yeshua transliteration. I for one am curious as to the nature of the so-called controversy you describe 
 *I am not sure what you mean about """"Judaic sources"""" claiming """"authoritarian ownership of Hebrew.  Which sources?  Did you mean Alkalai and Chomski?  I think they are authorities because of their research as linguists, not because they are Jewish (and I can only assume they are from their names, but I have no idea whatsoever how they self-identify or what their beliefs are).  The textbook on Biblical Hebrew I used in college was definitely written by a Gentile, I do not have it on hand; the Hebrew-English Concordance we used, Brown-Drivers-Briggs, was not by Jews.  So when you refer to """"Judaic sources"""" I really do not know what you are talking about and you have to spell it out for me. 
 * You want my sources contradicting your transliteration?  Please read my first comment on the talk page again.  Please read the second one.  Please read Andrew Card's.  I never claimed to have any sources contradicting your transliteration, indeed, I said - and I wrote this yesterday, it was in my first comment - I said your reconstruction was plausible.  our reason for reverting it is not because we have sources contradicting it.  It is because we know of no historical sources that provide Jesus' name in Hebrew or Aramaic (which by the way I never said were unrelated.  Never.)  Andre, Leadwind, and I are reverting your edit because we are supporting a consensus reached by many editors, who reached that conclusion because no historian has ever provided a historical source for Jesus' name in Hebrew or in Aramaic.  Will Durant speculated what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name would have been but it is a speculation.  There is no mainstream view, because there are no historical sources.  I said this several times: N-O S-O-U-R-C-E-S.  Why do you ask me for my source when I gave as my reason the fact that there are n...o  s...o..u..r..c..e..s?  
 * You want to know the controversy I describe.  The Yeshu stories in the Talmud are considered by some modern scholars to be about Jesus (and by the way, those modern scholars do not see them as pejorative of Jesus but as reflecting through stories Jews' ambivalent feelings about Jesus and Christianity), but many modern scholars as well as medieval scholars argue that they are not about Jesus (in which case they cannot possibly be pejorative about Jesus and Christianity).  One reason why there is this controversy (is it Jesus?  is it not?) is because it is unclear what """"ha notzri"""" means - many argue that it is a reference to a religious community described by Jerimiah (long before Jesus was born, and not """"Nazarene"""").  And of course the other reason is that it is not at all clear that Yeshu or Yeshua was Jesus' name in Aramaic.  All of this controversy does not mean that Yeshu or Yeshua was not Jesus' name in Aramaic.  It does mean that we do not know.  My point was that the one case where we definitely have an Aramaic name, the earliest text with an Aramaic name one might think was Jesus's Aramaic name, there is lots of controversy as to whether this name has any connection to Jesus, and whether the name is proper Aramaic, and what the name means or who it refers to.  If there is all this controversy over the earliest texts we have with an Aramaic name, it seems to me that the most one could do today is say that Jesus' Aramaic name may have been Yeshu or Yeshua.  We just have no reliable historical documents relating to this question. 

 Without any reliable sources, any claim as to what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name was would be original research, and that is forbidden by Wikipedia policy. 

 Get it?  I am not saying my sources about Jesus' are better than your and I never said my sources were better than yours (I simply pointed out what was false in some claims you made about Hebrew and Aramaic.  And that has nothing to do with someone being Jewish and someone being Christian, it was you who suggested and seem to continue to suggest that.  You are not wrong """"because"""" you are Christian.  You are just wrong.  And Christian who is also a scholar of Biblical Hebrew and of Aramaic and of Ancient Near Eastern history would also tell you you were wrong about your claims about Hebrew and Aramaic).  I am saying that THERE ARE NO HISTORICAL SOURCES AS TO JESUS"""" HEBREW OR ARAMAIC NAME so any Wikipedian making a reconstruction IS VIOLATING NOR.

 1946 

 Ground-breaking Ceremony  
 at Sunnydale Academy  

 Promptly at 2 o'clock on the afternoon  
 of February 18 a goodly number of  
 workers, lay members, business associates  
 and friends from the surrounding com-  
 munities met on the future nine-acre  
 campus for a ground-breaking ceremony  
 marking the beginning of the girls' dorm-  
 itory, the first building to be erected at  
 our academy.  

 The program was presented from a  
 temporary platform erected on the future  
 site of the new building. Superinten-  
 dent H. C. Hartman served as master of  
 ceremonies, introducing the program  
 and speakers.  

 Elder Leon Robbins from St. Louis  
 offered the opening prayer. Elder G. E.  
 Hutches, president of the board of di-  
 rectors, sketched the """"Historic Back-  
 ground,"""" relating the activities of the  
 academy commission from the day it  
 was organized until the day in October,  
 1945, when the end of the long search  
 for an academy site was reached.  

 A hearty welcome was extended to the  
 academy from Centralia by Mr. Julius Ed-  
 wards from the First National Bank and  
 from the community by Mr. John  
 Shindler.  

 Elder G. R. Fattic, Central Union ed-  
 ucational secretary, outlined the purposes  
 and objectives of our three hundred ed-  
 ucational institutions the world over,  
 assuring the hearers that we had come  

 to be a permanent institution in this  
 community and the state of Missouri.  

 Elder E. E. Cossentine, president of  
 Union College, welcomed Sunnydale  
 \cademv into the sisterhood of acade-  
 mies comprising Union's territory. He  
 stated that Union College would be  
 happy to accept the first graduates as  
 well as future graduates in view of the  
 fact that Sunnydale will be staffed quite  
 largely by fully accredited teachers from  
 Union College.  

 Mr. Hartman pointed out the loca-  
 tions of the proposed building sites for  
 the girls' dormitory, boys' domitory, ad-  
 ministration building, teachers' cottages,  
 superintendent's home, and other fu-  
 ture structures to be erected on the  
 spacious nine-acre plot. He then intro-  
 duced Mr. Robert Deering, Columbia  
 arcritect who drew the plans for the  
 girls' domitory. Mr. Deering briefly out-  
 lined the outstanding features of the  
 building which will house 80 girls and  
 expressed his belief in its beauty, prac-  
 tibility, and adequacy.  

 Staff Sergeant Willard L. Bresee was  
 next introduced as building supervisor  
 and he made a brief response. Because  
 of Sgt. Bresee's experience in supervising  
 the erection of a number of other large  
 buildings, such as the auditorium and  
 Don Lo\e industrial building located  
 on the Union College campus, we can  
 be assured of well constructed edifices.  

 In an earnest dedicatory prayer Elder  
 C. M. Babcock from Columbia pre-  
 sented the plot of ground to the throne  
 of grace, asking that the purposes for  
 which it had been set aside be carried  
 out.  

 Then with Mr. Hartman at the con-  
 trols of a caterpillar tractor and Elder  
 Hutches guiding the plow, Mr. HerscJiel  
 Turner driv ing -a team of typical Missouri  
 mules and Elder Babcock holding an-  
 other plow, deep furrows were made in  
 preparation for laving the foundation  
 of the new building.  

 In spite of cloudv, wet weather every-  
 one seemed to recognize the advantages  
 of a location where pure air, sunshine, and  
 spacious, roomy lawns provide an ideal  
 setting for student home life.  

 A serious, interested atmosphere pre-  
 \aded the group as this milestone was  
 reached, and we rejoice that our acad-  
 emy is started; for its primary purpose  

 is to help save Missouri youth and aid  
 in preparing them for the kingdom of  
 God.

 == Renaming == 

 I don't think this renaming is a good idea. Where there is one name which is by far the most common (as is the case here), it should be under that title. If Jane Eyre (the character) is made into an article, the approprite naming scheme would look like this: 

 Jane Eyre 
 -the page about the novel 

 Jane Eyre (disambiguation) 
 -containing links to all the others: 

 Jane Eyre (character) 
 Jane Eyre (musical) 
 Jane Eyre (opera) 
 etc.

 The photo has excellent quality (better than many others) and it shows three beautiful houses of Amsterdam. In Amsterdam there are hundreds  of them. That's why I uploaded this photo. If you want to delete any photo there are plenty of useless and low quality photos in wikipedia to delete.

 Diameter – Width of the diamond as measured thru the girdle 
 Table – Largest facet of a gemstone 
 Crown – Portion of the diamond extending from girdle to table 
 Girdle – Intersection of Crown & Pavilion.  Defines Perimeter of Diamond 
 Pavilion – Bottom portion of the gemstone extending from girdle to culet 
 Culet – The Facet at the tip of the gemstone.  Preferred culet is not visible with unaided eye (“none” or “small”) 
 Depth – Height of Gemstone from Culet to Table 
 Crown Angle – angle of the Bezel Facet relative to the table plane 
 Pavilion Angle – angle of the main facet plane with respect to the table plane 

 The presence of absence of the culet make the diamond either a 58 or 57 faceted  
 one.  There are differing points of view of whether a diamond needs a culet.  Some  
 people say that the absence of a culet ensures that light stays within the diamond.

0192e3c7e75e272e,"Ring mail, mail, plate mail. 

 Hello 
 There is indeed several type of mail and again in different countries ended up calling them a different way. 

 All the historical mail I have seen is 1 in 4 or 1 in 6, oriental style as in Japanese and Moghul/ Mongolian, this done with flat or round rings. 

 Now if I say 1 in 4 to you how do you know if I am refencing the “European” 1 in 4 or kagomegata-gusari  futae-gusari, kame-ko-gusari (or the Indian equivalent) 

 Oriental mail organises the ring differently. The rings are flat on the fabric and they are linked but much smaller oval rings. There are several patterns. Regardless it is very different in construction from “European” mail. 
 My understanding, and I can be wrong, is that the Victorian used the tern ring mail to describe the European mail in opposition to the oriental way, which was called chain mail. 
 To be fair, it has good as anything yes the even the flat rings when mounted looks like a succession of rings and the oriental mounting look like a chain.  

 If you take some Moguls, Mongol and Islamic armour, some of them have the same oriental disposition and link small plate of metal. Those plates are separated by and attached to strip of mail.

0196edbfdbd1741c,"""The whole concept of blocking and banning is an anachronistic tribal practice that not only predates the advent of the Rule of Law, it's the very subject of the first three laws ever carved onto stone tablets, some 3750 years ago... 

  
 Hammurabi of Mesopotamia 

 These are the first three laws, in their entirety, of the Code of Hammurabi, translated into English: 

 :1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death. 

 :2. If any one bring an accusation against a man, and the accused go to the river and leap into the river, if he sink in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house. But if the river prove that the accused is not guilty, and he escape unhurt, then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death, while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser.  

 :3. If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death.  

 The second law seems bizarre by modern standards. It appears to be the source of the dismissive phrase, """"Go jump in the lake.""""  (Compare to the Yiddish expression, Nem zich a vaneh! """"Go take a bath!  Go jump in the lake!"""") 

 There are 282 such laws in the Code of Hammurabi, each no more than a sentence or two.  The 282 laws are bracketed by a pukeworthy Prologue in which Hammurabi introduces himself, and a narcissistic Epilogue in which he affirms his authority and sets forth his hopes and prayers for his code of laws. 

 Note that Wikipedia is not even as evolved as Hammurabi, since Wikipedia does not even do the level of due process required of Hammurabi's first law. 

 Given that Wikipedia has adopted an anachronistic pre-Hammurabic tribalistic ochlocracy that does not even rise to the level of the Code of Hammurabi, is it any wonder that Wikipedia is the venue of recurring classic liminal social drama that reprises the oldest stories in the annals of human history?   

 Hammurabi's notion was to advise everyone to go jump in the lake when they are tainted with an unproven allegation. 

 I reckon the secular cultural practice of absolution through ablution inspired the Early Morning Baptisers of Qumran to co-opt Hammurabi's Remedy into the Mikvah Ritual Bath. Baptismal sin cleansing survives to this day in most Christian denominations. 

 Of course there was that interlude in the desert where there were no bodies of holy water, so Aaron devised an alternate ritual involving a delightful goat named Caprice. I am rather fond of Caprice, since her story inspired portions of the Passion of Christ. 

 I find it ironic that a site that purports to offer the sum of all human knowledge is still struggling to learn the oldest lessons in the annals of human history. 

 So I suggest people wash their hands of Jimbo's anachronistic cult of pre-Hammurabic tribalism, cleanse themselves of the grit by jumping in the lake, and evolving to a more modern and enlightened governance model along the lines suggested by such innovative pioneers as Moses, Socrates, Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tsu, Maimonides, Thomas Becket, Stephen Langton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, ML King, Thich Nhat Hanh, John Rawls, Father John Dear, Barak Obama, Kermit the Frog, and Barsoom Tork Associates.

 == Heritage Listed Buildings == 

 I was looking up information on heritage listed buildings in Albury, with regards to state listings vs local council only listings. 

 The main two references I could found were Wikipedia, and an article in The Border Mail which is here:  
 http://www.bordermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/alburys-heritage-buildings-at-risk/1834299.aspx 

 This article unfortunately doesn't provide a full listing, but it DOES conflict with the list provided on Wikipedia, specifically stating that specific buildings (ie the Post Office) are NOT state heritage listed, when Wikipedia states that it is. Another building, the Waterstreets Hotel, I know for a fact is defiantely state heritage listed as it correctly states in the Border Mail article, but it is NOT listed on the Wikipedia list. Also noticed that the list on here seems to have two double ups as well, further calling it's reliablity into doubt. 

 Does anyone know where a full, referenced list of state heritage listed buildings in Albury? It would be good to get this right, and then perhaps also make a list of """"other significant historical buildings in Albury"""" or something like that.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
